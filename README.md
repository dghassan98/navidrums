# Navidrums

A lightweight self-hosted web application for browsing and downloading music to your Navidrome library.
Optimized for low-end hardware.

**Multi-Provider Architecture**: Browse, download and stream via Monochrome — a single API instance covers all three. HiFi (Tidal API proxy) and Qobuz remain available as alternatives or fallbacks.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Browse & Search**: Discover artists, albums, playlists, and tracks from Monochrome, HiFi (Tidal) or Qobuz catalog APIs
- **Stream Preview**: Play tracks directly from search results with play/pause controls on track cards
- **Download Queue**: Asynchronous job queuing with configurable concurrency control
- **Multi-Provider**: Separate provider selection for metadata browsing, downloads, and streaming — run everything on Monochrome, or mix in HiFi and Qobuz in any combination
- **Quality Selection**: Choose from LOSSLESS, HI_RES_LOSSLESS, HIGH, or LOW audio quality

### Download Management
- **Queue Page**: Monitor active downloads with real-time progress updates
- **Downloads Browser**: Browse, search (by track, album, artist, genre), filter (by genre including "no_genre"), and manage downloaded tracks with bulk actions (delete, sync, set metadata)
- **Bulk Metadata**: Set genre, year, mood, and style for multiple tracks at once
- **Sync to File**: Re-tag audio files with updated metadata from Database
- **Sync All**: Fetch missing metadata from provider (Monochrome/HiFi/Qobuz) and MusicBrainz, update Database and sync to files
- **History Tracking**: View last 20 completed/failed/cancelled downloads
- **Job Management**: Cancel active jobs, retry failed downloads, clear history
- **Stuck Job Recovery**: Automatic reset of interrupted downloads on startup

### Metadata & Tagging
- **Comprehensive Tagging**: Automatically embeds metadata in audio files:
  - **Basic**: Title, Artist(s), Album Artist(s), Album, Track/Disc Numbers
  - **Release Details**: Year, Release Date, Genre, Label, ISRC, Copyright, Composer
  - **Extended**: BPM, Key, KeyScale, ReplayGain, Peak levels, MusicBrainz IDs
  - **Mood/Style**: Custom mood and style tags for personal organization (manual addition by track or bulk action)
  - **Commercial**: Barcode, Catalog Number, Release Type
  - **Lyrics**: Unsynchronized lyrics (LYRICS) and subtitles (LRC format)
- **Album Art Handling**: Embedded cover art + saved as `cover.jpg` in album folders
- **Playlist Images**: Cover images saved to playlists folder
- **MusicBrainz Integration**: Metadata enrichment using ISRC codes and genre fetching

### File Management
- **Format Support**: FLAC and MP3 audio formats (MP4/M4A support stubbed)
- **File Verification**: SHA256 hash checking with `LastVerifiedAt` tracking
- **Path Organization**: Configurable directory structure via Go templates
- **Path Sanitization**: Automatic cleaning of invalid filesystem characters
- **Empty Directory Cleanup**: Automatic removal of empty folders after deletions
- **Playlist Generation**: Automatic M3U file creation for playlists and artist top tracks

### Multi-Provider Architecture
- **Separate Per-Operation Selection**: Choose different providers for metadata browsing, downloads, and streaming
- **Provider Types**: Monochrome, Qobuz Direct (your own subscription), HiFi (Tidal API proxy) and Qobuz (shared proxy) — each can have multiple endpoint URLs as fallbacks
- **Provider Fallback**: Multiple URLs of the same type tried in order until one succeeds
- **Per-Type Caching**: Each provider chain has its own response cache with configurable TTL
- **API Throttling**: Built-in request throttling for external APIs (Monochrome, HiFi, Qobuz, MusicBrainz) to prevent rate limiting

### Performance & Reliability
- **Automatic Retries**: Exponential backoff with 3 attempts for failed downloads
- **Concurrent Downloads**: Configurable worker concurrency (default: 2)
- **File Hash Verification**: Prevents duplicate downloads via hash matching
- **Statistics Tracking**: Job success/failure rates and performance metrics

### User Interface
- **HTMX-Powered**: Responsive UI with no JSON APIs for frontend
- **Real-time Updates**: Live progress updates without page reloads
- **Component-based**: Modular templates for maintainable UI code
- **Basic Authentication**: Optional HTTP basic auth protection
- **Track Details View**: Comprehensive file, audio, and MusicBrainz metadata display

### Settings
- **Provider Management**: Add, reorder, edit, and remove Monochrome, HiFi and Qobuz provider URLs; select which provider type to use per operation (metadata, download, streaming)
- **Qobuz Credential Health**: Enter Qobuz credentials in Settings and test them with one click — an expired auth token and a rotated app secret are reported separately, so you know which one to replace
- **Password-Gated Settings**: Set `NAVIDRUMS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` to require a password before Settings can be viewed or changed
- **Download Notifications**: Posts to a Discord webhook or Apprise endpoint when a download finishes, fails or is cancelled — once per album rather than once per track
- **Genre Mapping**: Customize how MusicBrainz genres are normalized (maps sub-genres to main genres)
- **Genre Separator**: Configure the separator used when writing multiple genres to audio tags
- **Theme Selector**: Override the default application theme configured via environment variable

### Security

**Recommended: Use Cloudflare Tunnel and Zero Trust instead of basic auth**

For production deployments exposed to the internet, we strongly recommend using a reverse proxy with built-in authentication instead of HTTP basic auth:

- **Cloudflare Tunnel (Zero Trust)**: Tunnel your service through Cloudflare withAccess policies, SSO integration, and built-in DDoS protection
- **Traefik**: Configure OAuth2 or ForwardAuth middleware
- **Nginx**: Use Auth_request module with external auth service
- **Caddy**: Built-in OAuth2 or Cloudflare API key support

Basic auth has limitations:
- Credentials sent with every request (even if over HTTPS)
- No MFA/SSO support
- Hard to revoke without changing passwords

When using a proxy with authentication, set `SKIP_AUTH=true` to disable built-in auth:
```bash
SKIP_AUTH=true ./navidrums
```

Rate limiting is still applied as a second layer of protection.

### Data Architecture
- **Two-Table Design**: Jobs (work queue) + Tracks (full metadata) separation
- **SQLite Database**: Efficient embedded database with WAL mode for concurrency
- **Data Invariants**: Prevents duplicate downloads, ensures file-tagging order

## Prerequisites

- **Docker & Docker Compose** (for Docker installation only)
- **Go 1.22+** (for building from source)
- **A Monochrome API instance** — covers metadata, downloads and streaming. Fresh installs are pre-configured with `https://lol.samidy.workers.dev`; add your own in Settings
- **A HiFi (Tidal) API proxy** (optional alternative for metadata browsing, e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000`)
- **A Qobuz API proxy** (optional alternative for downloads/streaming, e.g., `https://qobuz.kennyy.com.br/api`)
- **ffmpeg** (optional, only needed for MP4/M4A tagging - commonly required for hi-res downloads)

| `QOBUZ_PASSWORD` | (empty) | Your Qobuz password, hashed to MD5 at startup |
| `QOBUZ_PASSWORD_MD5` | (empty) | Pre-hashed password; wins over `QOBUZ_PASSWORD` |
| `FFMPEG_PATH` | (system) | Path to ffmpeg binary (required for MP4/M4A tagging) |
| `FFPROBE_PATH` | (system) | Path to ffprobe binary |

ffmpeg and ffprobe are automatically detected most of the times, but you can override them with the above variables if needed.

**Previews instead of full tracks**: the legacy HiFi/Tidal `/track/` route often returns 30-second previews, especially at HI_RES_LOSSLESS quality. Monochrome fixed this by moving playback to `/trackManifests/`, and Navidrums now reports a preview as a failure rather than saving a 30-second clip — so the next configured instance gets a chance at the full track. What an instance can serve still depends on the accounts behind it:
- **Metadata (search/browse)**: any Monochrome or HiFi instance works well
- **Download / Streaming**: Monochrome instances serve full-length audio; add several as fallbacks, or fall back to Qobuz

See [MONOCHROME_API.md](MONOCHROME_API.md) for the API details.

**Template Variables:**

The `SUBDIR_TEMPLATE` uses Go's `text/template` syntax. Available variables:
- `{{.AlbumArtist}}` - Album artist (falls back to track artist if empty)
- `{{.OriginalYear}}` - Release year (integer)
- `{{.Album}}` - Album name
- `{{.Disc}}` - Disc number, zero-padded (01, 02, etc.)
- `{{.Track}}` - Track number, zero-padded (01, 02, etc.)
- `{{.Title}}` - Track title

The file extension (`.flac`, `.mp3`, or `.mp4`) is appended automatically.

**Example:** The default template produces paths like:
```
~/Downloads/navidrums/Pink Floyd/1973 - The Dark Side of the Moon/01-01 Speak to Me.flac
```

**Note:** Invalid filesystem characters (`<>:"/\|?*`) are automatically sanitized from paths.

   ```

### Self-Hosted Server Setup

#### Running as a Systemd Service (Linux)

1. Create a systemd service file at `/etc/systemd/system/navidrums.service`:

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Navidrums Music Downloader
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   User=YOUR_USERNAME
   WorkingDirectory=/home/YOUR_USERNAME/navidrums
   Environment="PORT=8080"
   Environment="DB_PATH=/home/YOUR_USERNAME/navidrums/navidrums.db"
   Environment="DOWNLOADS_DIR=/home/YOUR_USERNAME/Music"
   Environment="PROVIDER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000"
   Environment="QUALITY=LOSSLESS"
   Environment="NAVIDRUMS_USERNAME=navidrums"
   Environment="NAVIDRUMS_PASSWORD=password"
   ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/navidrums
   Restart=always
   RestartSec=10

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

2. Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual username and adjust paths as needed.

3. Enable and start the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable navidrums
   sudo systemctl start navidrums
   ```

4. Check service status:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status navidrums
   ```


**Note:** The binary is self-contained with all templates and assets embedded. You only need the single executable file to run the application.

   - Build and push Docker image to GHCR (`ghcr.io/cesargomez89/navidrums:v1.0.0`)
   - Create a GitHub release

## Architecture

Navidrums follows a clean layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Data Architecture
- **Two-Table Design**: Jobs (minimal work queue) + Tracks (full metadata and download state)
- **Job Lifecycle**: `queued → running → completed | failed | cancelled`
- **Track Lifecycle**: `missing → queued → downloading → downloaded → processing → completed | failed`
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Unique `provider_id` constraint prevents duplicate downloads

### Layer Separation
- **HTTP Handlers**: Request parsing and HTML rendering only
- **Application Services**: Business logic and workflow orchestration  
- **Repository**: Database persistence and queries
- **Providers**: External API adapters (HiFi/Tidal, Qobuz) with multi-provider manager, per-type fallback, and caching decorator
- **Storage**: Filesystem operations and path management
- **Workers**: Background job processing with concurrency control

### Multi-Provider Design
- **ProviderManager**: Central orchestrator with three independent provider chains — metadata, download, streaming
- **FallbackProvider**: Tries multiple URLs of the same type in order until one succeeds
- **CachedProvider**: Decorator wrapping each chain with response caching
- **Per-Operation Selection**: Settings store which provider type (HiFi or Qobuz) to use per operation. Defaults to HiFi
- **No Cross-Type Fallback**: Provider choice is per-operation, not automatic fallback — configure in Settings

### Key Design Principles
- No downloads in HTTP handlers
- No goroutines in HTTP handlers  
- No database access outside store package
- No file writes outside storage package
- All heavy operations run asynchronously via background workers
