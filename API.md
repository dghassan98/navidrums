## Behavior

All POST endpoints enqueue jobs asynchronously.
They never block waiting for downloads.
Jobs are processed by background workers.

Download types accepted:
- `track` - Single track
- `album` - Full album (decomposes into tracks, saves cover.jpg)
- `playlist` - Playlist (decomposes into tracks, generates M3U file)
- `artist` - Artist top tracks (decomposes into tracks, generates M3U file)
- `discography` - Artist discography (decomposes into albums, saves cover.jpg)

## Response Formats

### HTML Fragments
HTMX endpoints return HTML fragments for DOM replacement.

### JSON (Providers)
`{"predefined": [...], "custom": [...], "active": "url", "default": "url"}`

### JSON (Genre Map)
`{"default": {...}, "custom": {...}}` — `custom` is null if not set.
